#  As a user, I want to track my daily moods on a website so that I can better understand and manage my emotional well-being.

-	As a user, I want to be able to log my mood daily, selecting from a range of predefined mood options (e.g., happy, sad, stressed, calm, excited, etc.).
-	I should be able to provide additional context or notes about my mood, such as the reasons behind it.
-	The system should allow me to record the time and date for each mood entry.
-	I want to see my mood entries visually represented, such as through graphs or charts, so I can easily track mood trends over time.
-	The visual representation should be easy to interpret and provide insights into my emotional patterns.
-	As a user, I want to create and customize my profile by adding a profile picture and personal information (e.g., name, age, gender).
-	I should have the option to edit or update my profile information at any time.

-	I want the ability to maintain a personal blog within the website where I can write and publish posts about my thoughts, experiences, and reflections.
-	Each blog post should have a title, content area, and the option to include an image.

-	I should have a way to provide feedback or contact support if I encounter issues or have suggestions for improvement.
