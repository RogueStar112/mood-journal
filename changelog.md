# Changelog - 10/10/23

The index.html has been updated to include real information replacing lorem. Thoughts regarding a picture next to the tagline were considered
but no decisions made just yet. The contact form is a stretch goal so we are waiting a little longer to combat that.

On the mood tracker page, a massive amount of code has gone in ( 1 driver, 3 navigators) to correctly display the blog title, blog time, blog post on the blog page. This was done using JS functions, loops and LocalStorage. This works as intended, any present bugs are now fixed.

The blog page correctly displays blog posts.

The About-us.index now has pictures of the group members, the lorem has been replaced with text describing a small bio about the team and their
role within this project.

More work has been put in to the breathing animation to make it more seamless.

A light/dark toggle is being worked on - currently fixing bugs.

- Created chart.js to display the data generated in a neat chart at the bottom of the Mood Tracker page, this allows the user to track their mood over a long period of time. Additionally added some CSS editing to center the chart on the page. - Tyler
